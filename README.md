## Summary of Findings

> Analysis this Prosper dataset to gain insights the following are my finidngs: 
> Majority of the Borrowers were Employed and hd occupations like Professionals in their differnt field,Computer programmer, administrative assistant. It is worthy of note that most of them were upper middle income earners of mimimum of $12000 as salary. The greater the wage group the loan amount collected originally, while a decrease in the wage amount of each borrower leads to a corresponding increase in the annual pErcentage Rate of the Borrowers.
> We discovered that those with one year term have completed theirs and also five(5) year term is more for the current loan status Also those of low income doesn't have much of the one year term this may be becuase of the monthly amount that will be collected. also unlike expected the high income earners didnt borrow over a five(5) year term.
> We observed that the borrower APR was higher for a year than for other term. Also the three year term has the highest borrower APR.
> we discovered that those who are currently paying the money borrowed borrow the highest mount, also those that are defaulters seems to owe for long hence the amount borrowed. Also those the arc are thinner for tose in final payment in progress this is because not many persons are in this category.

## Key Insights for Presentation


> Considering the Borrower APR, the strongest postive correlation is its correlation with Borrower Rate this implies that we the borrower rate has a stong degree to determining the value of borrower APR. 
> Looking at the Loan Original Amount we discover that the higher the Wage group the higher the Term and the higher the Loan original amount.
> Comparing the Borrower APR and the original loan amount given,we see a negative correlation which implie that the greater the Borrower APR the lower the origina loan amount.
